# RPG-game



RPG-game is a text-based, basic role-playing game built in pure Python.


### Tech

RPG-game uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python 3.8.1] - HTML enhanced for web apps!

And of course the game itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

RPG-game requires [Python v. 3.6. or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run.

So far no additional dependencies are required to run.

```sh
$ cd battle
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ main.py
```
